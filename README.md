# P3DStuff

This repository includes the work developed while doing the "3D Programming" course.

It includes two main projects:
  - A raytracer implementing techniques such as nff models import, anti-aliasing, soft shadows, depth of field and acceleration by using an uniform grid;
  - A game developed in Unity 3D which implements techniques such as ambient occlusion and Motion Blur.
